# CFA-CSS-Grav-Clone

## Objective

We were to take a sample landing page and recreate it with our own CSS/HTML skills. The purpose was for us to put the grid system in designing pages into practice and also to become more familiarised with front-end web design!

### Get Grav
The original landing page was a fairly intense landing page from getgrav.org. The current Grav landing page has since changed.

The original that we referenced is below:

## Result

The end result turned out to be far from what I wanted - but I did get a lot of exposure and experience in learning so it was worth it!

## Challenges

- CSS in general was quite a challenge!
- Getting used to the Bootstrap framework
- Flexbox, though meant to make life easy - was quite a struggle for me at the start! I now understand rows, containers etc much better! :)

### That's it for now folks!
